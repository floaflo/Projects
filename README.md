# Projects
This repository highlights my work in data analysis and visualization. It features a collection of case studies, code examples, and analytical reports created with Python, SQL, Power BI, and other tools. The aim is to demonstrate my abilities in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, statistical modeling, and effective data storytelling.
